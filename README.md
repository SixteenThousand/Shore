### She sells shell scripts by sea shore...

This repo is just where I keep little handy shell scripts. At the moment it 
contains:

- **cond**: wrapper around `test`/an if block that can be used to quickly 
  check `test`'s syntax/whether a command runs without error.
- **jsonpretty** (requires jq): takes a JSON file & reformats it to have 
  indentation
