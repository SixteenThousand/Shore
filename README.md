### She sells shell scripts by sea shore...

This repo is just where I keep little handy shell scripts. At the moment it 
contains:

- **cond**: Wrapper around a bash if statement. Useful for checking the 
  syntax of `test` conditions.
- **sorrento**: A loading spinner, *a.k.a*, a Sorrento
- **twist**: A simple wrapper around cURL that makes HTTP requests very 
  simple to do.

For more information, please the relevant file for each script; 
alternatively, you could download the script, and run it with the `--help` 
flag.
