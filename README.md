*She sells shell scripts by sea shore...*

This repo contains a bunch of handy little shell scripts I wrote between 
2022(?) and 2024. I'm not currently doing anything with it, but it's here 
for anyone who may be interested in a few shell tricks.

It's written in a mixture of POSIX (sh) script (likely with some bash-isms 
included by mistake), fish script (I know, I know, bad idea) and PowerShell 
(sadly no batch scripts here though).

- **cond**: Wrapper around a bash if statement. Useful for checking the 
  syntax of `test` conditions.
- **sorrento**: A loading spinner, *a.k.a*, a Sorrento
- **twist**: A simple wrapper around cURL that makes HTTP requests very 
  simple to do.
- **gitout**: A search & replace tool for file names, for files managed by 
  git.

For more information, please read the scripts yourself; they should all 
either be very simple or have help messages built in that explain what they 
do in detail.
